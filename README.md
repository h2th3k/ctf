# Call me if you can

Introduction: the binary has a temper, it only anwser and cast the flag to its master (whoever knows its name).

To get the flag, try input a special chunk of value. Simply by executing it (you don't need anything else):

```
./0xcallm3ifUcan_sp
```

Hint: You could also feed it the input from pipe line. By using `echo` or other methods you feel comfortable.

Notice: The flag is in plaintext. However it is secretly 'protected', don't try to change the value or format. Otherwise you will not get the flag. The 'real' flag will only be print out when the magic value is found. (The real flag will start with `[+]` mark)
